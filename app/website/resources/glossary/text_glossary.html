    In some instances, after evaluating the evidence, the D.A.'s Office may

    individual committed a specific offense, and will decline to prosecute a
    case. In other instances, the D.A.'s Office may decline to prosecute a case
    while law enforcement continues to gather evidence or because the case
    lacks prosecutorial merit. The D.A.'s Office may likewise decline to
    prosecute a case if an individual successfully completes a pre-arraignment
    diversion program. In Manhattan, our Office makes pre-arraignment diversion
    programs available to most individuals who are: 1) charged with low-level
    offenses (<a

    element of the crime. In New York State, each of the 62 counties has a
    District Attorney who is an official elected to prosecute the crimes in

    counties, each with its own D.A.'s Office: New York County (Manhattan),
    Kings County (Brooklyn), Queens County (Queens), Bronx County (the Bronx),

<p>
    <b>Precinct: </b>
    New York City is divided into 77 precincts, or geographic districts, which
    are patrolled by units of the NYPD.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Prison Sentence:</b>

    placed on probation in lieu of imprisonment. This department also conducts
    pre-sentence investigations used by judges when determining sentences.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Problem Solving Courts:</b>
    Problem-solving courts are specialized courts within the criminal justice
    system that seek to address underlying problems contributing to criminal
    behavior. Generally, a problem-solving court involves a close collaboration
    between a judge(s) and a community service team to develop a case plan and
    closely monitor a charged individual's compliance.

    <b>Qualifying Offenses:</b>
    New York State's bail reform laws limited the use of cash bail. Now,
    typically, bail can only be set on cases with a "Qualifying Offense." Most
    Qualifying Offenses are violent felonies, such as robbery, assault, certain
    criminal contempt charges, misdemeanor and felony sex offenses, and
    homicide. Not all Qualifying Offenses will result in bail, however. Judges
    may still choose ROR or Supervised Release. Depending on the Qualifying
    Offense, the judge may also remand the individual instead of setting bail.
    On the other hand, cash bail is typically no longer permitted for most
    misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies. In rare instances, however, such as
    the individual being charged repeatedly and willfully failing to appear in
    court, or if an individual causes harm to a person or property while being
    paroled on a case involving harm to a person or property, a judge may set
    bail on an offense that does not constitute a "qualifying offense."

    individual is likely to not return to court or is likely to flee the
    jurisdiction, the court may determine that the individual must remain in
    custody until their case is disposed and/or sentenced. People charged with
    murder may be remanded.
</p>
<p>

    sufficiency of the evidence to support the charges originally brought by

    occurs in the Office's Early Case Assessment Bureau ("ECAB").
</p>
<p>
    <b>Sentence:</b>

    <b>Speedy Trial:</b>

    New York, Criminal Procedure Law Section 30.20 guarantees the same right,
    and Criminal Procedure Law Section 30.30 regarding prosecutorial readiness
    helps ensure that individuals are afforded that right. As a general rule,
    prosecutors have six months to commence a trial for most felony cases, 90
    days to commence a trial for Class A misdemeanor cases, 60 days for Class B
    misdemeanors, and 30 days for violations. The time it takes to conduct many
    legal proceedings, such as motions and competency screenings, often does
    not count against these timelines.

</p>
<p>

    A written instrument accusing an individual of a crime that has the same
    force as an indictment. SCIs are used when an individual charged with a
    felony agrees to waive indictment by a Grand Jury.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Supervised Release: </b>
    Supervised Release permits a judge to release a charged individual to a
    supervisory program that allows them to remain at liberty while awaiting
    trial. Supervised Release expands judges' options beyond setting monetary
    bail or releasing individuals on their own recognizance with no system in
    place to ensure their return to court, and provides intensive monitoring,
    frequent face-to-face and telephone contact with program staff, and
    referrals to outside agencies for additional services.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Supreme Court: </b>

    The most serious offense an individual is charged with.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Trial: </b>

    before a judge or a jury to determine whether there is proof beyond a
    reasonable doubt that the charged individual committed the alleged crime.

    <b>Violation/infraction: </b>
    An offense carrying the lowest sanctions. Violation/infractions are defined
    as noncrimes. A criminal record does not ensue when a person pleads guilty
    to a violation/infraction. The maximum term of imprisonment is fifteen
    days. Examples of violations/infractions are public urination, drinking
    alcohol in public, and disorderly conduct.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Voir Dire: </b>
    Voir Dire is the name given to jury selection. In Criminal Court, 6 jurors
    and 1 or 2 alternates are chosen. In Supreme Court, 12 jurors and 2 to 4
    alternates are chosen. When prospective jurors are brought to the
    courtroom, the judge will explain certain principles of the law and
    question the prospective jurors. Prosecutors and defense attorneys question
    the jurors, and either side may bring a limited number of challenges to the
    judge, arguing that a certain prospective juror should not sit on the case.
    The remaining jurors are sworn in. The process continues until the full
    number of jurors and alternates is chosen.
