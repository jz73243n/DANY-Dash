
confineIntro <- "Individuals convicted of a misdemeanor under New York State 
law are eligible to be sentenced to up to 364 days of incarceration. Individuals 
convicted of a felony who receive an incarceratory sentence face anywhere from 
one year to life in prison, depending on the severity of the crime and the 
individual's previous convictions, among other factors. These sentences may be 
determinate (i.e. consisting of an exact length of confinement) or indeterminate 
(i.e. consisting of a range of time with a minimum and maximum length of 
confinement). In this dashboard, sentences are grouped by either the total 
length (if the sentence is determinate) or minimum length (if the sentence is 
indeterminate). For example, a determinate sentence of 2 years and an 
indeterminate sentence of 3 - 5 years would both be grouped as 1-3 year 
sentences."

monetaryIntro <- "Monetary sentences refer to judge-imposed punishments 
following a conviction at trial or guilty plea where the convicted individual 
or corporation  is required to make payment in the form of a fine, restitution, 
or asset forfeiture. This does not refer to mandatory, court-imposed surcharges 
and fees that are assessed following a conviction. 
<ul>
<li>
Fines consist of the payment of money to the state. Article 80 of New York's 
Penal Law determines the amount an individual or corporation can be fined. Some offenses, 
such driving while impaired and aggravated unlicensed operation of 
a vehicle, have mandatory fines in lieu of incarceration.
</li>
<li>
Restitution consists of the payment of money to a specified individual or 
organization, typically the victim. Restitution is case-specific; examples 
include the cost of a victim's medical bills, or payment of funds that were 
stolen from an organization. 
</li>
<li>
Asset forfeiture consists of the confiscation of assets or property by the 
state. Asset forfeiture sentences are relatively rare and are therefore 
excluded from this dashboard.
</li>
</ul>
