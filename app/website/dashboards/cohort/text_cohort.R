cohortsIntro <- "The cohorts by race/ethnicity dashboard provides information
on prosecutorial outcomes for specific groups of individuals based on the year
their case came to the Manhattan D.A.'s Office. Cases arrested and screened in the same year 
are treated as part of the same \"arrest cohort\" (i.e. cases arrested and screened
in 2013 belong to the 2013 arrest cohort). The purpose of this dashboard is to
compare prosecutorial outcomes for each arrest cohort across different race/ethnicities
and over time. For example, you might compare the number or percentage of cases declined
to prosecute (\"DPed\") in the Office's Early Case Assessment Bureau (\"ECAB\"), 
for White versus Black individuals that were arrested and screened in 2013. 
To look at changes in outcomes for individuals of each race/ethnicity over time, 
you might, for example, compare the number or percentage of cases DPed in ECAB 
for Hispanic individuals arrested and screened by the Office in 2013 versus 2019. 
<br>Note: race/ethnicity data is recorded by the NYPD and is not self-reported 
by the arrested individual."

cohortsIntro2 <- "
The graphs on this page compare outcomes at key stages throughout the duration of a case 
grouped by the arrested or charged individual's race/ethnicity. All demographic data is 
reported to the Manhattan D.A.'s Office by the NYPD. The NYPD records an individual's 
gender and race/ethnicity based on how they physically appear, not by self-identification. 
Therefore, it is very common to see an arrested individual's race and ethnicity recorded differently at each arrest.
<br>
All arrests screened between 2013 and 2020 are separated into arrest 
\"cohorts\" based on their screen year. The purpose of these graphs is to 
compare the outcomes for all cases opened in the same year. These cohorts are 
further narrowed to focus on individuals identified as belonging to a shared 
racial/ethnic group. A general template for interpreting the statistics on 
this page is detailed below: 
<ol>
<li style='opacity: 1;'>
[#] of [race/ethnicity] individuals arrested and prosecuted on a [charge category] in [year] had [outcome]. 
<ol style='list-style-type: lower-alpha;'>
  <li style='opacity:1;'> Eg. 3,273 of 4,570 Black individuals arrested and 
  prosecuted on a felony in 2019 had bail requested at criminal 
  court arraignment.</li>
  </ol>
<li style='opacity:1;'>
[%] of [race/ethnicity] individuals arrested and prosecuted on a [charge category] in 
[year] had [outcome].
<ol style='list-style-type: lower-alpha;'>
  <li style='opacity:1;'> Eg. 71.9% of Black individuals arrested and 
  prosecuted on a felony in 2019 had bail requested at criminal court 
  arraignment.</li>
