arrScreenIntro <- "In the majority of cases, an arrest is the first stage in the criminal justice process. An arrest occurs when a police officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person being arrested has committed a particular offense. Depending on the offense, the arresting officer may give the charged individual a Desk Appearance Ticket (\"DAT\") or escort the individual downtown for processing as a \"live\"  or \"online\" arrest. In most cases, an Assistant D.A. first reviews (\"screens\") an arrest in the Office's Early Case Assessment Bureau (\"ECAB\"). In New York, a person may be prosecuted under three major categories of offenses: violations/infractions, misdemeanors, and felonies. In 2019, the Manhattan D.A.'s Office screened 46,117 arrests, a 55.2% decrease in arrests screened since 2013. The graphs below provide information pertaining to arrests screened by the Manhattan D.A.'s Office, broken down by year, arrest type and most common arrest charges."

arrDpIntro <- "In some instances, after evaluating the evidence, the D.A.'s Office may determine that there is insufficient reasonable cause to believe an individual committed a specific offense, and will decline to prosecute (\"DP\") a case. In other instances, the D.A.'s Office may decline to prosecute a case while law enforcement continues to gather evidence or because the case lacks prosecutorial merit.<br/><br/>
The D.A.'s Office may likewise decline to prosecute a case if an individual successfully completes a pre-arraignment diversion program (a light-touch, community-based intervention). In Manhattan, pre-arraignment diversion programs are available to most individuals who are: 1) charged with low-level offenses (Project Reset), 2) charged with failing to answer a summons or pay a fine for having their driver's licenses suspended (<a href='https://www.manhattanda.org/projectgreenlight/'>Project Green Light)</a>, or 3) charged with misdemeanor drug possession (Manhattan Hope).<br/><br/>
In 2019, the Manhattan D.A.'s Office declined to prosecute 4,208 cases (9.1% of all arrests screened). The proportion of cases prosecuted in 2019 (90.9%) declined by 6% compared to 2013 (96.9%). The total number of arrests prosecuted declined by 58.0% between 2013 and 2019. The graphs below provide information about arrests that the Manhattan D.A.'s Office declined to prosecute, broken down by year, category and reason."

arrDpPolicyIntro <- "In 2018, the Manhattan D.A.'s Office implemented policies to end the criminal prosecution of certain misdemeanor offenses. Among others, this included a decline to prosecute (\"DP\") policy for marijuana possession and smoking, and <a href='https://www.manhattanda.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Fare-Beating-Fact-Sheet-v3.pdf'>theft of services</a> (subway fare evasion).<br/><br/>
In the first year of the Office's marijuana declination policy, which went into effect in August 2018, the number of marijuana possession and smoking cases declined by 98%. In the first year of the Office's theft of services declination policy, which went into effect in February 2018, the number of subway fare evasion prosecutions decreased by 95%. The graphs below provide information pertaining to these arrest charges, broken down by year.<br/><br/>"

arrProsIntro <- "Assistant D.A.s review (\"screen\") every arrest to determine the sufficiency of the evidence to support the charges brought 
by the police. The Assistant D.A. may choose to 1) decline to prosecute the case; 2) uphold the charge or adopt an equivalent charge; 
3) upgrade the charge due to factors like newly discovered evidence; or 4) downgrade the charge due to insufficient evidence. 
Once the prosecutor determines the final charges (\"ECAB complaint charges\"), they draft the complaint upon which the arrested individual 
will be prosecuted. In 2019, 45.2% of felony arrest charges, 93.5% of misdemeanor arrest charges and 85.2% of violation/infractions arrest charges 
were maintained at screening."
