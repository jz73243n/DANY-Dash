    Cohorts allow us to track outcomes for a group of defendants whose cases
    were opened in the same year. These cohorts are further narrowed to focus
    on defendants identified as belonging to a shared racial/ethnic group. A
    general template for interpreting the statistics on this page is detailed
    below:
